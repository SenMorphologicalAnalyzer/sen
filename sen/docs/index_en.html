Sen (Morphological Analyzer)

<h1>What is Sen?</h1>
Sen is a the open source Japanese morphological analyser.  Sen derives
from <a
href="http://cl.aist-nara.ac.jp/~taku-ku/software/">ChaSenTNG</a>
which is written by C++. Takashi Okamoto rewrote the ChaSenTNG with
Java. It was purposed to use Japanese by 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/">jakarta lucene</a>. 
But it may be useful fo National Language Processing.

<h1>Origin of Software Name</h1>
<p>
There are two origin.
</p>
<p>
In the first, <a href="http://chasen.aist-nara.ac.jp/">'ChaSen'</a> is
the most famous Japanese morphological analzer. I was not professional
for Natural Language Processing, so I thought my morphological
analyzer can't win ChaSen. So, I just removed 'Cha' from 'ChaSen'.
</p>

<p>
Second, currently Sen supports only Japanese but if someone prepares
the dictionary for other language, Sen would be able to treat
additional language. The author hope sen will grow international
morphological analyzer. Then, he thinks it's excelent that a lot of
people know Japanese good culture through his software. So he named
Sen which is name of heroine of the most famous movie 'Sen to Chihiro
no kamikakushi' (The title in English is 'The Spirited Away') in Japan. 
Even neither Star Wars nor E.T was able to beat 'Sen to Chihiro no
Kamikakushi' in Japan. Chihiro no Kamikakushi is not evaluated only 
Japanese but also european. In the fact, Sen took 'golden bear prize' 
at Berlin movie festival.
